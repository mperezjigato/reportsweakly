## Atomistic Geometries

The software **CIF2CELL**, **atomsk**, **open babel** and **atomic simulation environment** are utilised for geometry creation, manipulation or conversion. There is an interesting point regarding the graphics with ASE: If you create an XYZ formatted file during ASE total energy calculation and convert it to CIF using "ase convert" (use ASE as a geometry tool, with no total energy calculation), the resulting CIF is *perfectly sanitised* ("standard setting") via CIF2STD (cryst.ehu.es). On the other hand, if you convert the XYZ file produced with ASE using atomsk, the resulting CIF file does not pass the validation test (neither a cell is defined nor a spacegroup). We have tested it on the CIF file that gives rise to the picture below (EMT optimisation for (atop) N2 adsorbed on Cu(111)) - both CIF and image files have been uploaded to this repository -:

On the other hand, the three input file generators materialscloud.org, AFLOW and CIF2CELL are being compared from the point of view of the creation of quantum espresso input files and the particular example of orthorhombic PdAg2O2. Both conventional 10 atom cell and primitive 5 atom cell are being considered. Further consistency conventional-primitive cell is to be sought with the spacegroup tool of ELK and with the cryst.ehu.es tools.

It must be noted that the inverse process of looking at geometries of QE outputs, converting them to different formats and reconfirming the space group assignent can be initiated with XCRYSDEN. Incidentally, the latter has the possibility of producing WIEN2K structure files. Moreover, the same analysis of QE inputs/outputs started with XCRYSDEN is to be tried with open babel, which, unfortunatelly, it can only read QE files, not convert other formats into them.
