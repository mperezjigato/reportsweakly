## Atomistic Geometries

The software **CIF2CELL**, **atomsk**, **open babel** and **atomic simulation environment** are applied to the creation of geometry files as well as to their manipulation and conversion. ASE generated geometry files seem to be of "higher quality" than others: If you create an XYZ formatted file during ASE total energy calculation and convert it to the CIF format using "ase convert", the resulting CIF file is *perfectly validated* ("standard setting") by CIF2STD (cryst.ehu.es). On the other hand, if the ASE generated XYZ file, is converted by means of atomsk, the resulting CIF file does not pass the validation test (neither a cell is defined nor a spacegroup). The picture below (EMT optimisation for (atop) N2 adsorbed on Cu(111)) corresponds to the CIF/XYZ files tested above - both CIF and image files have been uploaded to this repository -:

On the other hand, the three input file generators materialscloud.org, AFLOW and CIF2CELL are being compared from the point of view of the creation of quantum espresso input files and the particular example of body-centred orthorhombic PdAg2O2. Both conventional 10 atom cell and primitive 5 atom cell are being considered. Further consistency conventional-primitive cell is to be sought with the "spacegroup" tool of ELK [^1] (FP-LAPW code) and with the cryst.ehu.es tools.

It must be noted that the inverse process of extracting geometries from QE outputs as well as converting them to different formats and reconfirming the space group assignment, can be initiated with XCRYSDEN. Incidentally, the latter has the possibility of producing WIEN2K [^2] (a FP-APW+lo code) structure files. Moreover, the same analysis of QE inputs/outputs started with XCRYSDEN is to be tried with "open babel", which, can read QE input/output (PWSCF) files, but not convert files with a different format into PWSCF input format.

A few geometries produced with ASE are discussed next. Since the result of geometry optimisation using empirical potentials is very fast and therfore parallel computation is out of the question for the time being, I have decided to include these as part of the atomistic geometry section. Furthermore, EMT empirical potentials are not reliable in surface chemistry, therefore, the resulting geometries are utlised only as examples for this section (geometry tutorial).

The tutorials for both ASE and GPAW are being tried/studies, as well as the software extensions WULFPACK and SSCHA. The latter considers calculations of some caliber based on both quantum-espresso and ASE.
