# Internship - week 13 - summary

ASE calculations using empirical potentials from the OpenKIM collection, have been run for BCC metals. Tungsten (W) has been chosen as a testbed for having the highest melting point of all known materials.

## *The SNAP machine-learning potential*

Machine-learning potentials are derived from quantum mechanical DFT calculations, and this particular SNAP W potential has been tested on Tungsten surfaces by other workers (atomic Hydrogen adsorption on bcc W(100)), being one of the most exact force fields that are currently available for Tungsten.

### Bulk fcc W equation of state calculation - binding curve [^1, ^2]

Similarly to the bcc Ag binding curve computed in the report of week 10, the Python script used for ASE is shown below for fcc W, as well as the binding curve itself:

### Unreconstructed bcc W(111) surface - MPI weak scaling 

No input files, submission scripts or atomistic geometry files have been kept in this case. A time-wall table is shown below:

|number MPI cores |     1     |    16     |    64     |   144     |    400    |
|---------------- |-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
|   atom number   |    682    |   10912   |   43648   |   98208   |   272800  |
|surface extension|     -     |   (4x4)   |   (8x8)   |  (12x12)  |  (20x20)  |
|      time/s     |   1284    |   1288    |   1746    |   1781    |    1654   |
