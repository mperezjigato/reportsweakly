# Internship - Week 9 - Summary

At this point, and considering that we do not count with CPU time at Genius, it seems as a good idea trying to gather input and output files corresponding to all the calculations carried out so far with the Ab-Initio/MD software. The latter coincides with the tar files uploaded to the "computationalchemistry" repository, although without large pseudopotential (nor wavefunction) files. 

 On the other hand, installation work (on DSI guest2 laptop), is summarised below, as well as work on the first runs with the software below:

 - GROMACS
 - PLUMED
 - AlphaFold (not implemented by the intern, simply run on Genius, if possible)
 - OPENMM
 - OPENPLATHSAMPLING
 
 The last two codes are not separately implemented. Rather, they take part in the distribution of other software. Firstly, PLUMED is a free-energy calculation code that makes use of OPENPATHSAMPLING. Secondly, AlpaFold is a protein structure determination sofware that uses OPENMM as force-engine, and therefore, OpenMM is part of its distribution.

## HPC calculations: Inputs and outputs - Development of supercomputing training material regarding Ab-Initio/MD calculations

Following up the same order appearing in the computationalchemistry repository (README.md), input and output files are shown below

### ABINIT

### ASE

### LAMMPS

### QUANTUM-ESPRESSO

## HPC calculations: Installation and first runs on other software

This section constitutes a work plan in itself, since none of the codes have been run as yet. We are currently gathering information, particulary regarding input file syntax and example input files.
