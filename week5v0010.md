# Internship - Week 5 - Summary

## Progress on HPC runs of MD and Ab-Initio codes within the *Development of Supercomputing Training Material for Computational Chemistry* task

Three different systems are used as testbeds to explore the different parallelisation options of LAMMPS: The ethanol box calculation already described at week 4's report, a Lennard-Jones fluid calculation [^1] and the  silica amorphisation calculation described at the LAMMPS website tutorials [^2].

Pure OpenMP as well as pure MPI and hybrid runs are reported under specific submission parameters. Moreover, HPC runs including the Kokkos acceleration package of LAMMPS are considered. A set of job submission scripts have been uploaded in the "computationalchemistry" GitHub repository and total wall time tables are enclosed below for each of the reported cases:

In order to move towards more involved materials science applications, information is currently being gathered regarding metal solid solutions with applications as equiatomic high-entropy alloys [^3]. Geometry files in either CIF form or in simple coordinate "xyz" form are being sought. The intention is to get started with geometry optimisations on large scale systems using MD calculations (LAMMPS and/or ASE) in combination with empirical/semiempirical potentials, before considering quantum effects (ML potentials of SNAP type; Tight-binding; fully-fledged density-functional theory). Furthermore, local Ubuntu implementations of several codes that fall within the ASE umbrella are being carried out on the DSI laptop guest2.

## Templating

The following script transforms a (LAMMPS input file) template with a BASH shell script, ie without any external software:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

workh='tobe.txt'
cp template.txt $workh
outputf='tb.txt'; touch $outputf

tsys='ethanol'; delimiter=( "molecule" "create_atoms" ) 
printf -v datf "data.%s" $tsys
xFORM="C6H6"; xDATAP="$(pwd)/$datf"

printf -v lmole "grep %s %s" ${delimiter[0]} $workh
printf -v lcrat "grep %s %s" ${delimiter[1]} $workh

lm=`$lmole`
lc=`$lcrat`

while read input_text
do
  case $input_text in
        ${lm} | ${lc}) 
		eval echo $input_text
		;;
        *)              
		echo $input_text
                ;;
   esac
done < $workh > $outputf
```
In this case, the search/replace operation is carried out linewise, via a nested while-case loop. Certainly the `sed` option is still preferable: Carrying out several search/replace operations in a single step as opposed to generating an intermediate template.
