 - force fields from the "openkim" collection for bcc metals (W) are tested for bulk, surface and nanoparticle cases; 
 - interfaces with liquid water (TIP potentials) of both fcc and bcc metals;
 - a comprehensive test suite for GPAW is run and reported.
 
## Ag Nanostructures - ASE (EMT) geometry optimisation, GPAW (LCAO) self-consistent field electronic structure and GPAW electronic density of states calculations (*count.tar.gz* and *nanoparticlessilver.tar.gz*)

The "ase.cluster.octahedron" module allows the creation of atomistic geometries for this type of nanostructures, including both octahedra and truncated octahedra. The FCC Ag example from the ASE tutorial material has been chosen to be run (based on `ase.cluster.octahedra`). It includes (a) the generation of atomistic geometries and the ASE (EMT) optimisation; (b) the GPAW computation of the self-consistent electronic structure for the optimal cluster geometry, and (c) a GPAW electronic density of states calculation starting from the GPAW electronically converged system. All three steps are (MPI) run on Genius, for nanostructures of increasing size and a full weak-scaling study is presented. Incidentally, GPAW electronic structure calculations can be run using three different modes: (LCAO) atom-centered basis functions, real-space grids/multigrids and planewaves. This test has been run exclusively under (LCAO) atom-centered basis functions.

Two separate tables are shown: One with the number of atoms in the nanoparticle, the other with the MPI wall-time for the second step of the calculation (GPAW self-consistent field electronic structure calculation). Neither the first (EMT geometry optimisation) nor the third step (electronic density of states) are accounted for at this point. As a weak scaling problem, the number of MPI cores increases proportionally to the number of cluster atoms (the number of cores is ca. atom number divided by 10). On the other hand, two types of truncation is considered, ie a `cutoff=2` truncation and a cutoff 40 % truncation.

The first column contains the values of the main parameter defining the octahedron size (NPAR). The second one is the value of the truncation parameter c for 40 % of the original octahedron size parameter (NPAR).
The third, fourth and fifth columns contain the main piece of information of this table, ie the number of atoms of each specific cluster (pOH refers to "pure-octahedron"; tOH2 is the truncated octahedron originally built under size parameter NPAR and subsequent truncation variable c=2; tOH40 is the truncated octahedron originally built under size parameter NPAR and truncation variable c=40% of NPAR). The last three columns contain the number of MPI cores for each calculation.

 Regarding the wall-time table:

[^1]: The GPAW total energy calculation for this 891 atom (fcc Ag) octahedral nanoparticle (NPAR=11) has simply reached the time limit, without failure. Moreover, it should be noted that *the first step of the calculation, ie the EMT classical geometry optimisation (ASE), has converged in 43 cycles*. Regarding the GPAW total energy calculation, it must be mentioned that 89 electronic iterations had been completed before the calculation reached the time limit.

The GPAW scf calculations fail for NPAR above 11. After simple inspection of the total energies, it is apparent that they exhibit huge fluctuations, which, in turn, is characteristic of the charge sloshing behaviour of delocalised electronic systems (metals), when LCAO basis functions are used.
